    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last Updated: January 14, 2026</p>

    <p>Thank you for using the "Mad Yet" application. We take your privacy very seriously. This page is designed to
        inform you about our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information.</p>

    <h2>1. Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p><strong>100% Local:</strong>
        "Mad Yet" is a completely local application. We <strong>do not</strong> collect, store, or upload any of your
        personal data or "vent" content to our servers. All vent records are stored encrypted in your device's local
        folder.</p>

    <h2>2. Data Storage and Backup</h2>
    <p>All your records (vent history) are saved on your device. Please note:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> All data is stored encrypted in your device's local folder, protected by iOS
            file protection mechanisms.</li>
        <li><strong>System Backup:</strong> Your data is automatically included in iOS system backups (iTunes or iCloud
            backups). When you restore your device or switch to a new device, your vent records can be restored with the
            backup. All backup data is encrypted and protected by Apple.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Loss:</strong> If you delete the app or clear local cache without a backup, this data will be
            permanently lost. We cannot recover this data for you.</li>
        <li><strong>Our Commitment:</strong> We do not collect, upload, or access any of your data. Your privacy is
            entirely controlled by you and Apple's backup system.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. External Links</h2>
    <p>This app may contain links to third-party services (such as Apple Maps). When you click these links, you will
        leave this app and be subject to that third-party service's privacy policy.</p>

    <h2>4. Changes</h2>
    <p>We may update our privacy policy from time to time. We recommend that you review this page periodically to stay
        informed of any changes.</p>

    <h2>5. Contact Us</h2>
